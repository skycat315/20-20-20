# 20-20-20 for Your Eyes

## Overview

The 20-20-20 rule helps protect your eyes from strain. It means that every 20 minutes, you should look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Remembering to take these breaks can be tough.
Thatâ€™s why we created 20-20-20 for Your Eyes. This app sends gentle reminders for your eye health and runs in the background to save battery life. Plus, there are no ads to disrupt your experience.
Give your eyes the breaks they need and take care of your well-being!
